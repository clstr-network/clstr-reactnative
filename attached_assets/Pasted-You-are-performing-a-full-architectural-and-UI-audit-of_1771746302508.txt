You are performing a full architectural and UI audit of a React web application being converted to a React Native mobile application.

The goal is to ensure the mobile app is:

Native-first (not web-styled mobile)

Structurally correct

Flow-consistent

Design-token aligned

Interaction-optimized for touch

Lifecycle-safe

Performance-safe

CONTEXT

Web app:

Vite + React 18 + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui components

Radix primitives

Framer Motion

Supabase backend

TanStack Query

60+ routes

180+ components

Desktop-first responsive UI

Mobile app:

Expo + React Native

Shared core domain layer

Native navigation stacks

SecureStore auth

Realtime messaging

Screen registry pattern

No DOM

No Tailwind

No Radix

No hover states

No web layout assumptions

TASK 1 — FULL WORKING FLOW AUDIT

For each major flow:

Authentication flow (Login → Signup → Verify → Onboarding → Main)

Feed flow (Load → Scroll → Open post → Back)

Profile flow (Own vs Other)

Messaging flow (List → Chat → Reconnect)

Events flow (List → Detail → RSVP)

Network flow (Browse → Request → Accept)

Notifications flow (Badge → List → Navigate)

Settings flow (Theme → Logout → Delete)

For each flow:

Describe current web behavior

Identify web-only assumptions

Identify mobile friction points

Identify navigation differences

Identify state handling differences

Identify edge cases under background/foreground

Identify lifecycle risk

Identify potential gesture conflicts

Recommend native corrections

Output in structured sections per flow.

TASK 2 — UI & DESIGN SYSTEM AUDIT

Audit:

Color tokens

Spacing scale

Typography scale

Avatar sizing

Card density

Shadow usage

Border radius consistency

Iconography usage

Touch target sizes

Safe area usage

Dark mode behavior

For each:

Identify where web assumptions leak into mobile

Recommend native adjustments

Ensure consistent design tokens

Ensure accessibility (44px minimum tap targets)

TASK 3 — COMPONENT PARITY AUDIT

Evaluate required mobile components:

ConversationItem

PostCard

UserCard

EventCard

NotificationItem

SettingsRow

ChatInput

MessageBubble

TabBar

RootNavigator

Stack layouts

For each:

Describe web equivalent

Identify web-only patterns to remove

Define minimal native version (Phase 1 discipline)

Identify performance risks

Identify memoization needs

Identify FlatList usage constraints

Define what must NOT be included in V1

TASK 4 — LAYOUT ARCHITECTURE AUDIT

Audit:

Root layout

Tab layout

Stack nesting

Modal usage

Header usage

Back navigation behavior

Gesture handling

Deep linking integration

Screen registry pattern correctness

Answer:

Is navigation tree minimal?

Are stacks too deep?

Any circular screen imports?

Any inconsistent header configuration?

Any screen state leaks?

TASK 5 — THEME & APPEARANCE AUDIT

Evaluate:

Dark mode consistency

Theme persistence

Appearance API usage

System theme handling

Token centralization

No DOM theme leakage

Recommend improvements for:

Future theming scale

Animation discipline

Cross-platform consistency

TASK 6 — PERFORMANCE RISK AUDIT

Identify:

Unnecessary re-renders

FlatList misuse

Inverted list risks

Large object props

Inline functions in render

Missing React.memo

Query invalidation overuse

Memory leak risk

Realtime subscription lifecycle risks

TASK 7 — MOBILE-NATIVE CORRECTIONS

For each major screen:

Feed

Chat

Profile

Events

Network

Notifications

Settings

Answer:

What should be simplified?

What should be removed?

What should be redesigned?

What should stay identical?

What must feel native instead of web?

Where should layout differ from desktop?

Where should density be reduced?

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return:

Executive Summary (critical findings first)

Flow audit (per feature)

UI audit

Component audit

Layout audit

Performance audit

Native correction roadmap

Priority-ranked fix list (Critical / High / Medium / Low)

Be brutally honest.
Do not sugarcoat.
Call out architectural mistakes.
Flag lifecycle dangers.
Flag UX anti-patterns.
Flag anything that feels like web-in-a-wrapper.
